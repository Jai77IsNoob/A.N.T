# mod by Jai77IsNoob and Crossking!
this mod is for a server and a friend of mine, but idc who really uses this, If you see the shadow tier units looking weird, its probably because mindustry doesn't allow transparent units... This adds a bunch of content, NOTE that this mod isnt 100% balanced for vanilla.
